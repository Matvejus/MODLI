We describe which parameters we will use and why, together with a short explanation on the parameters we do not use.

#Things we do

Water – Refers to fresh water used in any stage and scaled according to the water scarcity index. This is represented in liters, and accounts for the amount of water needed to restore the balance of in- and outflux of water during the process to negate any local ecological damage. Thus, it favors water use in places where there is an abundance of water, and punishes water use where it is scarce.

Energy – The energy needed, direct and indirect, to finish the phase. This is represented in MJ-eq When seen over the entire life-cycle, it should encompass all energy used during extraction, manufacturing and disposal of the product. When using renewable resources instead of nonrenewables, this can be incorporated as well. 

CO2-equiv – The total emissions of greenhouse gasses during any of the phases. Measured in the well-known CO2-equiv. Similar to the Global Warming Potential (GWP). Is mainly influenced by fossil fuels, bio-based resources and change in land-use.

ReciPe – An aggregate scoring method that scores every possible metric into three main damage-categories: human health, ecosystems, and resource availability. Water Usage and Energy will primarily impact the first two, while the CO2-equiv will mostly be scored on resource availability.

#Non-environmental metrics

FTE Extra – Societal benefits (not necessarily local) in paid working hours for people with a distance to the labor market. Metric is in hours where 1720 hours is equivalent with one year full time employment.

Costs – The direct costs for the hospital directly involving the gowns. Metric in euro’s. For example the costs of the laundry and the cost of buying gowns. 




#Things we don't do.
There are 17 midpoint-categories that attribute to for example the ReCiPe-score. We only use three of these, namely Water use, Global Warming and Fossil Resources. We do not work with toxicity, land use or mineral resources. There are several reasons why we don't use them.

Particulate matter, top. ozone formation, ionizing radiation, human toxicity (cancer and non-cancer), freshwater eutrophication, trop. ozone (eco), terrestrial ecotoxicity, terrestrial acidification and mineral resources.
These are all impact factors that seem to be of little to no significance in the textile industry. 

Freshwater ecotoxicity and other toxicity factors. There might be some bleaching and chemical waste involved in making the gowns. However, it is very difficult to get reliable data on this on a gown basis: it is unknown which exact chemicals are used per manufacturer, per producer, per gown, or how they deal with their chemical waste, hence it will be very difficult to estimate the value of the impact factor. Any calculation on these parameters will be extremely uncertain. Moreover, other more detailed LCA's have not shown a very high impact for these toxicity parameters.

Land use. Even though for example cotton uses a lot of land globally, the impact is low compared to the other parameters. The biggest issue with cotton is not how much land it uses but how much water is needed to grow the cotton, for example.
