##WE NEED TO EXPAND EVERY ELEMENT WITH A CLEAR DESCRIPTION AND ADJUST ON THE FLY.

Interactive elements for the user:
- Gown-selection menu (dropdown?)
- Optimization preference (which parameter should be the leading factor?)
- Hospital specifications (usage, storage space?)
- Save-specs/Export outcome (any setting and decision by the model should be saved)
- Retrieve saved settings/outcomes
- Calculate procurement-plan button

Static:
- Visualisation of gown procurement plan (when calculated)
- LCA values of procurement plan (total and per gown?)
